<h1>Multi-Flooding Velocity Preview</h1>
		<p>Multi-Flooding Velocity Preview allows you to perform a quick visual quality assurance check of horizons 
		and parameters used in a constant velocity flood between multiple pairs of horizons at once. This is done by 
		flooding only the current Inline and Xline in the 3D Viewer. When Run is pressed, the output volume is put 
		on the Repository and must be displayed in the 3D Viewer. As you navigate through the volume, only the current 
		inline and xline are processed and results are sent back to the viewer. When results are ok, the entire volume 
		can be processed and output.</p>
	<h2>Overview of the Multi-Flooding Preview Algorithm</h2>
		<p>Multi-Flooding Preview performs a velocity flood with a constant velocity between several pairs of horizons, 
		allowing you to quickly check flood results. This algorithm also differs from the standard Velocity Flood by 
		allowing you to import several pairs of horizons and do a constant velocity flood between each pair of horizons 
		in one pass.</p>

		<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you run this algorithm, the output volume must be displayed in the 3D viewer. 
		Whenever the Inline or Xline are changed, the algorithm is automatically re-run to process the new lines and 
		the 3D Viewer is automatically updated. When the results are satisfactory, the entire volume can be processed 
		by right-clicking on the output volume in the Repository, selecting Export, and specifying a data store.</p>

	<h2>Performing a Quality Assurance Check on Data Sets with the Multi-Flooding Preview Algorithm</h2>
	<p><strong>Caution</strong>: When loading data, make sure that the unit labels are correct and consistent for all 
	input volumes <em>and</em> horizons. This is easily done by viewing the volume along with the horizons and seeing 
	that they are in the same area.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Load volume data into GeoCraft.</li>
			<li>Load horizon data into GeoCraft.</li>
			<li>Select an input <strong>Volume</strong>.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to select your top horizons.</li>
			<li>In the selection dialog, highlight the horizons you want to use in the preview and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
			<li><em>Optional</em> In the <strong>Top Horizons</strong> list box, highlight a horizon and click the button to 
			<strong>Remove</strong> it from the calculation; or to move it <strong>Up</strong> or <strong>Down</strong> in the 
			multiples calculation order.</li>
			<li>Repeat steps 4-6 to select and order the <strong>Base Horizons</strong> for the multiples flooding preview.</li>
			<li>Accept the <strong>Flood Velocity #<em>n</em></strong>, or type a new value in the field. Each pair of 
			top and base horizons will have its own field to set flood velocity. This field defaults to 5000 feet per second.</li>
			<li>Accept the <strong>Volume Name</strong>, or type a new value in the field. This is the name GeoCraft gives
			to the new volume that results from this calculation.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
	<p>GeoCraft performs the calculation. A process bar displays while the algorithm runs.</p>
	<p>When the algorithm completes its calculation, the Volume view opens to display the preview data.</p>
