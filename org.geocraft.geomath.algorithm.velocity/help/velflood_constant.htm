<h1>Flooding Salt Velocity with a Constant Flood Type</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Select the <strong>Constant(s) or Horizon(s)</strong> option:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Use a constant</strong> - GeoCraft uses a constant value to calculate flood velocity. 
				GeoCraft contains a default value in the <strong>Flood Velocity (ft/s)</strong> field. Water has a 
				constant velocity of 5000 feet per second, or approximately 1500 meters per second. However, if you have 
				data about the water temperature, depth, or pressure, you may want to type a different value in the 
				<strong>Flood Velocity (ft/s)</strong> field.</li>
				<li><strong>Use a horizon</strong> - GeoCraft varies the flood velocity with a horizon. If you use a horizon 
				for a variable velocity, select a <strong>Velocity horizon (ft/s)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: The data units of <em>each horizon</em> that you select during this task <em>must</em> 
	match the data unit of the input volume. For example, if the input volume is measured in feet per second, all horizons 
	used in this calculation must also be measured in feet per second.<br />
	If the data units for the input volume and any horizon in the calculation do not match, GeoCraft displays an error in the 
	<strong>System Messages</strong> window and does not complete the calculation.</p>
		<li>In the <strong>Volume Name (ft/s)</strong> field accept the default value, type characters after the underscore to 
		append to the volume name when the calculation runs, or clear the field and type in a new name.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>GeoCraft creates a new volume that is flooded with the salt velocity parameters you set during this task. You can use 
	a GeoCraft viewer to review the results of the calculation.</p>
