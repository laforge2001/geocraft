<h1>Flooding Salt Velocity with a Dataset Flood Type</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Select a <strong>Dataset volume</strong>.</li>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: The data units for <em>each volume</em> that you select during this task 
	<em>must</em> match the data unit of the input volume. For example, if the input volume is measured in 
	feet per second, all volumes used in this calculation must also be measured in feet per second.<br />
	If the data units for the input volume and any volume in the calculation do not match, GeoCraft displays an 
	error in the <strong>System Messages</strong> window and does not complete the calculation.</p>
		<li>In the <strong>Volume Name (ft/s)</strong> field accept the default value, type characters after the underscore 
		to append to the volume name when the calculation runs, or clear the field and type in a new name.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>GeoCraft creates a new volume that is flooded with the salt velocity parameters you set during this task. You can use a 
	GeoCraft viewer to review the results of the calculation.</p>
