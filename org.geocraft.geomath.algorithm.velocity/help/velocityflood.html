<h1>Velocity Flood</h1>
	<p>Velocity Flood modifies velocities in regions above, below, or between horizons. Flood velocities 
	may be defined as constant, gradient, or another dataset.</p>
	<p>Velocity flooding can fail when bounding horizons have holes, different extents, or when they 
	cross over. These problems can be very difficult to spot in the output volume. Use the 
	<strong><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.geomath.algorithm.horizon/help/html/velocitymodelchecker.htm">
	Velocity Model Checker</a></strong> algorithm to identify problems before doing the flood. The 
	Velocity Model Checker algorithm is in the <strong>Horizon</strong> folder in 
	the algorithm tree . This algorithm creates a horizon that which is color coded to locate areas 
	of potential problems in the Map Viewer.</p>
	<p>Because velocity flooding can take a long time to complete, some flooding algorithms allow users 
	to preview results in the 3D Viewer for a single inline and xline prior to flooding the entire input 
	volume. These algorithms are located in the Algorithms tree under the <strong><a href="floodpreview.htm">Preview Algorithms</a></strong> 
	folder.</p>
