<h1>Velocity Flood Preview</h1>
		<p>Velocity Flood Preview allows you to perform a quick visual quality assurance check of horizons 
		and parameters used in velocity flooding. This is done by flooding only the current Inline and Xline 
		in the 3D Viewer. When Run is pressed, the output volume is put on the Repository and must be 
		displayed in the 3D Viewer. As you navigate through the volume, only the current inline and xline 
		are processed and results are sent back to the viewer. When results are ok, the entire volume 
		can be processed and output.</p>
		<p>This version of Velocity Flood is basically identical to the standard (non-preview) Velocity 
		Flood except that users can quickly view results as they navigate in the 3D Viewer.</p>
	<h2>Overview of the Velocity Flood Preview Algorithm</h2>
		<p>Velocity Flood Preview does a velocity flood calculation. When the algorithm completes, the 
		results are displayed in the 3D viewer so that you can check the data for anomalies (for example, 
		holes in the top or base salt horizons).</p>

		<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you run this algorithm, the output volume must be displayed in the 3D viewer. 
		Whenever the Inline or Xline are changed, the algorithm is automatically re-run to process the new lines and 
		the 3D Viewer is automatically updated. When the results are satisfactory, the entire volume can be processed 
		by right-clicking on the output volume in the Repository, selecting Export, and specifying a data store.</p>
		
	<h2>Performing a Quality Assurance Check on Data with the Velocity Flood Preview Algorithm</h2>
		<p>You use the same procedure to perform a quality assurance check of your data as you do to perform an
		actual velocity flood on the data. This procedure links you to several online help topics that you would use to complete
		a real velocity flood calculation.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="vf_datareq.htm">Ensure that the data set meets all Velocity Flooding Data Requirements</a>.</li>
			<li>Follow the steps outlined in <a href="velocityflood_1ststeps.html">Flooding Salt Velocity in GeoCraft: Starting the 
			Procedure</a> to begin the flooding process.</li>
			<li>Use one of the following procedures to run the type of salt flood you need performed on your data set:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="velflood_constant.htm">Flooding Salt Velocity with a Constant Flood Type</a></li>
					<li><a href="velflood_gradient.htm">Flooding Salt Velocity with a Gradient Flood Type</a></li>
					<li><a href="velflood_dataset.htm">Flooding Salt Velocity with a Dataset Flood Type</a></li>
				</ul>
			<li>Perform a quality assurance check on the data when GeoCraft displays the results in the 3D viewer.</li>
