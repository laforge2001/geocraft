<h1>Introduction to ABAVO</h1>
	<p>ABAVO (Amplitude/Background and Amplitude Variation with Offset) is an amplitude versus offset 
	crossplot analysis program developed by ConocoPhillips Company.</p>
<p>ABAVO analyzes amplitude variations with offset to determine whether lithology or fluid changes in a 
	geographical area might be visible. ABAVO uses either normal incidence (A) and gradient (B); or near and 
	far seismic sections as the input source of data for crossplot analysis. Then, geoscientists interpret these 
	A and B crossplots. The corresponding fluid factor trends are calculated by ABAVO and displayed graphically.</p>
<h2>Overview of ABAVO</h2>
	<p>ABAVO can analyze 2D and 3D seismic data. This is the ABAVO workflow; follow these steps when
	working in ABAVO:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Compute the intercept and gradient for a background data series.</li>
			<li>Compute the intercept and gradient for an anomalous data series.</li>
			<li>ABAVO uses the intercept-gradient crossplots to construct a background ellipse and a
			maximum ellipse; this results in a defined ellipse model where AVO classes are color-coded
			by region.</li>
			<li>You may push seismic data sets through the ellipse model to locate and analyze other anomalies by color.</li>
			<li><em>Optional</em> You may also construct a polygon from the crossplot and use the polygon
			to locate similar anomalies on the seismic data set.</li>
		</ol>
<h2>Using the ABAVO Input Panels</h2>
	<p>Before you can perform most ABAVO functions, you must enter data on the ABAVO input panels. These tabs are located 
	in the lower-left corner of the panel, as shown	in the following figure.</p>

	<p><em>ABAVO data input tabs</em></p>
	<p>For detailed instructions about how to enter data for each tab, view the following topics:</p>

			<li><a href="cb_procbounds.htm">Entering ABAVO Processing Bounds Data</a></li>
	</ul>
<h2>Starting ABAVO Algorithms</h2>
	<p>The best way to start up ABAVO is to first open the ABAVO perspective if GeoCraft is not 
	already in this perspective. Do this by clicking <em>Perspectives => ABAVO 2D</em> for 2D 
	seismic, or <em>Perspectives => ABAVO 3D</em> for 3D seismic. When GeoCraft switches to the 
	ABAVO perspective, the ABAVO Crossplot window is created and the <em>Crossplot A vs B</em> 
	algorithm is opened in the main window. Other ABAVO algorithms can be launched directly from 
	the crossplot window using the <a href="av_alg_buttons.htm">ABAVO Algorithm Buttons</a>.</p>
