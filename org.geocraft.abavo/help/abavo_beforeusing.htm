<h1>Before You Use ABAVO</h1>
	<p>This topic contains brief descriptions of important ABAVO features and functionality that you should understand 
	before you use the program.</p>
		<table border="1">
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Feature or Function</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Explanation and Further Details</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>ABAVO Polygon Regions Model Features</td>
				<td>See <a href="av_crossplot_intro.htm">ABAVO Crossplot</a> for information about using the tools in the ABAVO Crossplot, 
				and how to use the features of Crossplot to create, manipulate, and analyze polygon region models.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>ABAVO Ellipse Regions Model</td>
				<td>See <a href="av_crossplot_intro.htm">ABAVO Crossplot</a> for information about using the tools in the ABAVO Crossplot, 
				and how to use the features of Crossplot to create, manipulate, and analyze ellipse region models.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Class (Background) Colors in ABAVO Crossplot</td>
				<td>The class (or background) color displays reflections in a color volume to depict seismic data. ABAVO shades the area between 
				the background and maximum ellipses from light to dark with the class color. Darker shades on a crossplot indicate anomalies. 
				The darker a background color is shaded, the stronger the anomaly.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Preparing for Each ABAVO Calculation</td>
				<td><p>Before you run any ABAVO calculations, you must:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>load either 2D or 3D seismic data into GeoCraft</li>
				<li>load horizon data into GeoCraft (<em>optional; only load this data if 
				you need to use it</em>)</li>
				<li>load Area of Interest (AOI) data into GeoCraft (<em>optional; only load this data if 
				you need to use it</em>)</li>
				<li>load wavelet data into GeoCraft (<em>optional; only load this data if you need to use it</em>)</li>
				<li>select the input data for your calculation</li>
				<li>select the pre-processing parameters for the job</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to load an existing crossplot or ellipse model, you do not need to 
			select input data or pre-processing parameters.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Retaining Data in ABAVO via the Active Series Feature in ABAVO Crossplot</td>
				<td><p>It is important to understand this feature before you use ABAVO. Active Series is a drop-down field 
				in the Crossplot window. The drop-down list contains values of 1 through 10 in the field. Active 
				Series holds up to 10 data sets at a time for ABAVO. If you want to retain the data set from a calculation
				that you ran, you must select a new Active Series value from the drop-down list in the Crossplot before 
				you run your next calculation.</p>
			<p>If you do not need to retain the data set from a calculation that you ran, you can leave 
			the Active Series field set to the same value. Before plotting points for the new calculation, 
			ABAVO will display a warning dialog to let you know that you are about to overwrite existing data. You 
			can either acknowledge that you want to overwrite the existing data, or cancel the operation and select a 
			new data series.</p>
			<p><strong>Caution</strong>: If you do not change the Active Series number <em>before</em> ABAVO plots the data points,
			you will lose existing data.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Plotting Data Sets in the ABAVO Crossplot</td>
				<td><p>The ABAVO Crossplot does not allow you to specify which data set (the background or the event) plots on top. 
				The first data set always gets plotted first, and the last data set is always plotted on top of all other data sets.</p> 
				<p>The background data set may have a large number of points, which means it could obscure an anomaly on any data sets 
				that are behind it. Therefore, you may want to select the background data set <em>first</em> when you are selecting 
				input data and parameters for an ABAVO job.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Viewing Plot Statistics and Processing Information</td>
				<td>ABAVO computes regression statistics as each data set is created. ABAVO reports the regression statistics and 
				processing information in the GeoCraft <strong>System Messages</strong> window.</td>
				</tr>
