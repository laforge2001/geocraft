<h1>ABAVO: Tips for Using the Plug-in and Improving Its Performance</h1>
		<p>The following tips will help you use ABAVO and ensure that the plug-in runs at its peak performance:</p>

					<tr>
					<td>Reduce the Amount of Time ABAVO Takes to Draw a Crossplot</td>
					<td><p>Make sure that each crossplot contains less than 200,000 points, particularly if you are creating
					several crossplot data sets at once. If several of your data sets exceed 200,000 points, ABAVO draws the crossplots slowly, and the 
					Java Virtual Machine (JVM) may run out of memory.</p>
					<p>Estimate the number of points in a crossplot with this equation:</p>
					<p><strong>number of inlines</strong> x <strong>number of crosslines</strong> x <strong>number of Time 
					samples</strong> = <strong>number of points in crossplot</strong></p>
					<p>If the total number of points is greater than 200,000, use one of the following options to reduce 
					the points in the crossplot:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>use the Peaks &amp; Troughs data mode</li>
							<li>reduce the time window for your calculation</li>
							<li>use an Area of Interest (AOI) to limit the inline and crossline range</li>
							<li>delete any data sets that you do not need from the crossplot</li>
						</ul></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>Use the Same Active Series Data and Regression Line to Create the Background <em>and</em> Event Ellipses</td>
					<td>If you want to construct a background and an event ellipse, you must use the same Active Series data number 
					and regression line to create both ellipses. If you use a different Active Series number or regression line in either 
					ellipse, the color class background will <em>not</em> display.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>View Plot Statistics and Processing Information While ABAVO Runs Calculations</td>
					<td>ABAVO automatically computes plot processing information and regression statistics as each data set 
					is completed. You can view the data results in the GeoCraft Error Log.</td>
					</tr>
