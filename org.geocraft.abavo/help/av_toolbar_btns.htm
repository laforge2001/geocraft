<h1>ABAVO Crossplot Toolbar Buttons</h1>
	<p>This table provides a quick reference for each toolbar button that is available in the ABAVO 
	Crossplot. The buttons are listed from the upper-most row to the lowest row, in left-to-right order.</p>
	<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Hover the cursor over any toolbar button to see its function.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td><strong>Toolbar Button</strong></td>
<td><strong>Functionality</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zoom In</td>
<td>moves toward an object, magnifying it; click this button to zoom in by the current zoom factor of the crossplot; zooming in can also be done by rolling the mouse wheel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zoom Out</td>
<td>moves away from an object, allowing you to see the object in a larger perspective; click this button to zoom out by the current zoom factor of the crossplot;
zooming out can also be done by rolling the mouse wheel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pan mode is disabled</td>
<td>
<p>toggles the pan mode on and off within the display; perform these steps to use this feature:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click <strong>Pan mode</strong>.</li>
		<li>Click the mouse button anywhere in the Crossplot window.</li>
		<li>Hold the mouse button down and drag the cursor in any direction within the crossplot. ABAVO tracks your movements, 
		scrolling the crossplot window in the same direction as the mouse cursor.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Pan mode</strong> once more to turn off this feature when you are done using it.</li>

	<tr>
	<td>Home View</td>
	<td>returns the object of focus in the crossplot view to the position in which it was originally mapped</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Cursor broadcast</td>
	<td>toggles the display of the cursor location on and off; when this feature is on, a light-yellow plus sign tracks your mouse 
	movements on-screen, and the X, Y, points are displayed on the bottom of the screen. Move the mouse to broadcast the current 
	cursor location. Hover the mouse over an area to display a tooltip with the current intercept and gradient point where the cursor is sitting.</td>

	<tr>
	<td>Layer model is shown</td>
	<td>toggles the <a href="av_displist.htm">Display List</a> on and off</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Edit the crossplot layout</td>
	<td>launches a <a href="av_canvas_layout_ed.htm">dialog box</a> where you set crossplot attributes. You can specify title height; 
	label height and width; and axis height and width.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Cursor tooltip is disabled</td>
	<td>toggles the cursor tooltip display on and off; when this feature is on, the intercept and gradient points of the cursor are displayed in a tooltip format as the mouse hovers over items on-screen</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Communication is disabled</td>
	<td>toggles communication on and off; when communication is activated, points chosen using the selection polygon or selection ellipse
	will be broadcast to external applications
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Edit the ellipse regions model</td>
	<td>launches a dialog box that allows you to edit the property settings for the <a href="av_ellipse_intro.htm">ellipse regions model</a> 
	on which you are working in the crossplot</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Edit the polygon regions model</td>
	<td>launches a dialog box so that you can edit the property settings for the <a href="av_crossplot_intro.htm">polygon model</a> on which 
	you are working in the crossplot</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Edit the depth color bar</td>
	<td>allows you to edit the colors associated with the depth values of the crossplot points</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Edit the class color bar</td>
	<td>allows you to edit the colors associated with the polygon model</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Crossplot anchor</td>
	<td>toggles the crossplot anchor on or off; when the anchor is on, the center of a plot will be fixed to 0,0 as point series are added<br /><strong>Tip</strong>: If you are trying to crossplot
	values that are all positive or all negative, then the anchor should be turned off, so that the center of the plot is not anchored to 0,0.</td>
