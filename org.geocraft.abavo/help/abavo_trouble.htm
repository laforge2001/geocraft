<h1>Troubleshooting ABAVO Problems</h1>
	<p>This topic provides descriptions for some common ABAVO problems, and tells you how to resolve each problem.</p>
		<table border="1">
					<tr>
					<td><strong>Symptom</strong></td>
					<td><strong>Cause</strong></td>
					<td><strong>Resolution</strong></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>ABAVO is taking a long time to draw crossplots.</td>
					<td>You may be creating one or more crossplots that contain data sets with more than 200,000 points.</td>
					<td>See <strong>Reducing the Amount of Time ABAVO Takes to Draw a Crossplot</strong> in <a href="abavo_performance.htm">ABAVO: Tips for 
					Using the Plug-in and Improving Its Performance</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>The Color Class Background does not display when ABAVO draws a background and event ellipse.</td>
					<td>You must use the same Active Series data number <em>and</em> the same regression line to create the background
					and event ellipses. If you select a different regression line or Active Series of data, the background color
					will not display.</td>
					<td>See <strong>Use the Same Active Series Data and Regression Line to Create the Background <em>and</em> Event Ellipses
					</strong> in <a href="abavo_performance.htm">ABAVO: Tips for Using the Plug-in and Improving Its Performance</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>The Color Class Background and Region Bounds do not display when ABAVO creates the background and event ellipses.</td>
					<td>When the Class Background or Region Bounds do not display, it is usually because some of the region lines
					are crossed.</td>
					<td><p>Perform the following procedure to resolve the issue.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Turn off the data points for the background and event ellipse data.</li>
							<li>See if any region lines cross each other.</li>
							<li>If region lines do cross each other, correct the problem:</li>
								<ol type="a">
									<li>Perform the steps in <a href="abavo_trouble_linepos.htm">Changing Line Position in a Crossplot</a>.</li>
									<li>Repeat the procedure in step <strong>a</strong> until all region lines are no longer crossed.</li>
									<li>Press mouse button 3 to refresh the ABAVO crossplot window.</li>
								</ol>
						</ol>
					</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>The Color Class Background does not match the Region Lines.</td>
					<td>The region lines within the plot need to be updated.</td>
					<td>Position the cursor in the Crossplot window and click mouse button 3 (MB3) to refresh the plot.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>I updated the region lines within the Crossplot, but the Color Class Background <em>still</em> does not match the region lines.</td>
					<td>A setting on the Ellipse Model table needs to be changed.</td>
					<td>
						<ol>
							<li>Click <strong>Edit Ellipse Model</strong>.</li>
							<li>Clear the <strong>Symmetry Lock on Region Bounds</strong> check box.</li>
							<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
						</ol>
					</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>I lost my existing data sets (or, existing data sets were overwritten when a crossplot was generated).</td>
					<td>You ran an ABAVO calculation <em>before</em> you selected a new Active Series number in the <strong>Crossplot</strong> window.
					The previous data that was associated with the Active Series number is lost; it cannot be retrieved.</td>
					<td>Select a new Active Series number before you run each new ABAVO job.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs out of memory and I cannot create crossplots.</td>
					<td>You may be creating one or more crossplots that contain data sets with more than 200,000 points.</td>
					<td>See <strong>Reducing the Amount of Time ABAVO Takes to Draw a Crossplot</strong> in <a href="abavo_performance.htm">ABAVO: Tips for
