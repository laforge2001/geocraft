<h1>Horizon Curvature</h1>
	<p>The Horizon Curvature algorithm computes various horizon-based curvature attributes.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Horizon Curvature Algorithm</h2>
	<p>Curvature analysis is a set of related - but different - <a href="curv_attrib.htm">surface attributes</a> 
	that you can compute for a horizon. These attributes are sensitive to subtle morphology changes, and can be useful 
	interpretation aids. Some interpreters refer to them as "second order derivatives."</p>
	
	<p>First order derivatives (such as Dip, Azimuth, and Edge-detect) can return faulty data at extreme 
	(very high or low) dip points. Azimuth,	for example, is unstable at low dips, and Dip becomes saturated 
	at high dips. When a surface is steeply dipping, all parts of the surface have high dips and subtle local
	features are not apparent on dip maps. The "second order" derivatives do not suffer from these types of problems.
	Thus, second order derivatives often reveal small-scale subtleties more objectively than first order derivatives.</p>
	
	When calculated from a surface, such as a seismic horizon, the curvature value depends on the direction in which 
	the curvature is measured. Positive curvature is associated with concave-down features, and negative curvature is
	associated with concave-up features. <p>See <a href="curv_attrib.htm">Horizon Curvature Attributes</a> for 
	details about the attributes offered in GeoCraft.</p>
	
	<p>Another important aspect of curvature analysis is aperture. Aperture is the window that determines how much surface data is 
	used in the calculations. Aperture is often	referred to as <em>wavelength</em>.	Short-wavelength (small aperture) curvature 
	displays can be contaminated by noise. Longer wavelength (larger aperture) curvature displays tend to be smoother. Different
	scales of features may be superimposed on an image, so calculating curvature with different apertures may be useful in your analysis.</p>
	
<h2>Performing Horizon Curvature Analysis on Data in GeoCraft</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Load horizon (grid) data into GeoCraft.</li>
		<li>Select a <strong>Horizon</strong>.</li>
		<li>Assign an <strong><a href="curv_attrib.htm">Attribute</a></strong> parameter.</li>
		<li>Type in an <strong>Aperture</strong> value.</li>
		<li>Accept the <strong>Name</strong>, or type in a new one.</li>
		<li><em>Optional</em> Type text in the <strong>Comments</strong> field. You will see this text in the 
		<strong>Properties</strong> view when you select the new horizon in the <strong>Repository</strong>.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>GeoCraft runs the calculation, and the resulting horizon populates in the <strong>Repository</strong> under 
	the <strong>Grids</strong> folder. You may now use the GeoCraft viewing tools to view the results 
	of the curvature analysis algorithm.</p>
	
<h3>Curvature Analysis Example</h3>
	<p>The image on the left is the original horizon. The image on the right is the maximum curvature 
	attribute computed with an aperture of 5.</p>
