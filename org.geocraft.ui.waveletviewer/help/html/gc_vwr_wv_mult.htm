<h1>Viewing Multiple Wavelets in a Single Plot</h1>
	<p>You can view multiple wavelets in a single plot by selecting more than one wavelet for display. 
	Each wavelet is assigned a different color. See the <strong>Hints</strong> section below to determine which color 
	represents each wavelet. Frequency spectra parameters can be set up in <strong>Edit -> Preferences</strong>.</p>
	<h2>Selecting Multiple Wavelets for Viewing</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Access the GeoCraft <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/concepts/repository.htm"><strong>Repository</strong></a>.</li>
			<li>Open the <strong>Wavelets</strong> folder.</li>
			<li>Hold down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key and click the starting and ending files to select multiple wavelets that 
			are grouped together in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/concepts/repository.htm"><strong>Repository</strong></a>. 
			Hold down the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and click individual files to select wavelets that are not next to each other.</li>

	<h2>Hints and Tips About Using the GeoCraft Wavelet Viewer to View Multiple Wavelets</h2>
		<p>Use the following hints and tips to optimize your use of the viewer. This figure shows the Wavelet Viewer 
		after selecting two wavelets. The <strong>Layer</strong> and <strong>Readout</strong> tabs are exposed on the 
		phase spectra plot. This allows you to hide or show each wavelet and read the wavelet or spectra values. This 
		feature can be used to determine which color corresponds to which wavelet.</p>
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: The phase spectra plot is optional; you are not required to display this plot in the Wavelet Viewer. See 
		<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/tasks/UserPreferences/waveletplotprefs.htm"> Setting Wavelet Plot Preferences </a> for 
		instructions about turning the display of the phase spectra plot on and off in the Wavelet Viewer.</p>

		<p>It is helpful to know the following information when working with the Wavelet Viewer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>GeoCraft plots each wavelet with a different color</li>
				<li>Toggle the <strong>Layer model is shown (hidden)</strong> button to show or hide the list of 
				wavelets that are currently displayed </li>
				<li>When the <strong>Layer model is shown</strong> button is selected, you can add or remove 
				wavelets from the viewer by selecting their corresponding check box in the <strong>Layers</strong> tab</li>
			</ul>
