<h1>Horizon to Area of Interest</h1>
	<p>Create an area of interest (AOI) from an existing 3D horizon by finding the horizon edge.</p>
<h2>Overview of Horizon to Area of Interest Algorithm</h2>
	<p>The Horizon to Area of Interest algorithm tries to create an area of interest (AOI) for an existing 3D 
	horizon in GeoCraft by searching row by row for the first non-null node and the last non-null node. That 
	is, it attempts to create the AOI as the outline of the edge of the input horizon.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> 3D AOIs can also be created graphically in Map View by drawing a polygon around 
	the area of interest, and by creating a rectangular AOI by limiting the Inline and Xline range and setting 
	a step or increment. The method described here is yet another way. Once created, the AOI is stored in the 
	Repository. It can be dragged out onto a Map view for visualization.</p>

	<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The 3D AOI is created "in memory". That is, it is not automatically saved and 
	restored. Nor does a right-click on the AOI and selecting <em>Save</em> actually save anything! <strong>You 
	<em>must</em> select <em>Export</em> and export the AOI to an ascii file.</strong> Then when you later restart GeoCraft 
	you must right-click on the AOI folder in the Repository and select <em>Load</em>.</p>
	
<h2>Running Horizon to Area of Interest</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Load a horizon into GeoCraft.</li>
		<li>Select an <strong>Input Horizon</strong></li>
		<li>Accept the default output <strong>Area of Interest Name</strong> or enter a new name.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>GeoCraft runs the algorithm, creates the AOI, and storing it in the Repository, in the 
	<strong>Areas of Interest</strong> folder.</p>
