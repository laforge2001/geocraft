<h1>Running GeoCraft Processes in the Background</h1>
	<p>If you are running an operation that may take some time, GeoCraft gives you the option to 
	send the operation to the background, so that you can continue working. If an operation takes 
	more than a few seconds to complete, you will see a dialog similar to this one. Click 
	<strong>Run in Background</strong> to send the task to the background.</p>
	<img src="background.gif" alt="Run in Background dialog" />
	<p><strong>Warning!</strong>: Do not make changes to the data set while the progress bar is running. If 
	you make changes to a data set that is in use while GeoCraft is running a process against that data set in the 
	background, you may lose your data set, or your data set may become corrupt.</p>
