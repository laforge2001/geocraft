<h1>The GeoCraft Workspace</h1>
	<p>The GeoCraft Workspace is a directory generally located in your <strong>/home</strong> area. 
	GeoCraft stores the following types of information in the Workspace:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>session files, which have a <strong>*.gcs</strong> filename extension and are stored in a subdirectory named <strong>/sessions</strong></li>
			<li>batch session files, which have a <strong>*.gcb</strong> filename extension and are stored in a subdirectory named <strong>/gcbatch</strong></li>
			<li>a hidden file containing your last active session and the last option selection to restore it on launch</li>
			<li><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/tasks/UserPreferences/gc_setprefs_scope.htm">global user preferences</a></li>
		</ul>
	Session files can be copied from one workspace to another as long as you want to restore the same data and have file access permission for that data store. 

	<h2>Closing GeoCraft Sessions</h2>
    <p><strong>Warning!</strong> If you click the <strong>X</strong> in the top right corner of a 
    GeoCraft window to quit the session, this immediately closes all separate plot windows. As a result, any plots in separate 
    windows cannot be saved as part of your session state. Instead, when you are ready to exit GeoCraft, 
    always use <strong>File => Exit</strong> on the main menu. </p>
