<h1>Editing Data Sets in Third-party Software While GeoCraft is Processing the Data</h1>
	<p>The data stores that you work with while performing geophysical calculations in GeoCraft may come from a variety of third-party 
	software vendors.</p> 
	<p>While GeoCraft is processing the data, make sure that the data set is <em>not</em> modified in the third-party software package from which 
	which GeoCraft is reading the data set.</p>
	<p><strong>Caution!</strong>: If a data set is modified within a third-party software package while GeoCraft is trying to process
	a function, GeoCraft will not be able to complete the function. In addition, objects within the data set may be lost or corrupted 
	during processing, and suffer permanent damage.</p>
