<h1>Running Multiple Instances of GeoCraft</h1>
	<p>You may run more than one instance of GeoCraft simultaneously. However, if you do run more than one instance of
	GeoCraft at once, make sure that you do <em>not</em> edit or write to the same data set in both instances of 
	GeoCraft simultaneously.</p>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: Do not attempt to read the same data set with two instances of GeoCraft that are running simultaneously, because this could create an 
	I/O bottleneck. For example, if multiple GeoCraft sessions were running, and two processes tried to read the same input volume at the same time, both processes 
	could slow considerably.</p>
	<p><strong>Caution!</strong>: If you edit a data set in multiple instances of GeoCraft, you may lose or corrupt the data set. To avoid data corruption 
	or data loss, do not edit a data set from multiple instances of GeoCraft simultaneously, and do not have GeoCraft write output from two or more processes that 
	are running at the same time, to the same file.</p>
