<h1>GeoCraft Sessions: Loading Data that Does Not Match Unit Preferences</h1>
	<p>Project data that you load into GeoCraft should match the unit preferences defined in your 
	GeoCraft workspace. If you load data into GeoCraft that is in different units, 
	GeoCraft will load the data but will convert the units to match the session unit system. GeoCraft 
	does not change projection coordinate systems, nor data units, such as velocity in m/sec to ft/sec.</p>
	<p>See the following topics for a detailed explanation about how GeoCraft handles units, and unit mismatches when data are loaded:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="workspace_datamismatch.htm">Loading Data that Does Not Match Unit Preferences</a></li>
			<li><a href="gc_uom_concept.htm">Unit Preference Settings and How GeoCraft Performs Data Unit Conversions</a></li>
		</ul>
	<p>When data is about to be loaded from a different unit system, GeoCraft will display a warning message in the 
	<strong>Load</strong> dialog box, as shown below.</p> 
	
	<p><img src="unitwarn.gif" alt="GeoCraft warning message indicating that units for data being 
	loaded do not match unit preferences for workspace session" /></p>
	<p>Generally, units should not matter. However, if a session could be saved in one unit system
	and then restored later in another unit system, there is the potential for X,Ys to be in error. 
	To help prevent this GeoCraft sessions have a fixed unit system which cannot be changed. If 
	another session is restored, the unit system of that session is maintained.</p>
