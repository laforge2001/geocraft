<h1>GeoCraft Session Files</h1>
	<p>GeoCraft creates two types of session files:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>*.gcs</strong>: GeoCraft session files, which are stored in the GeoCraft 
			<strong>workspace/sessions</strong> subdirectory</li>
			<li><strong>*.gcb</strong>: GeoCraft session batch files, which are stored in the GeoCraft 
			<strong>workspace/gcbatch</strong> subdirectory</li>
		</ul>
	<p>By default, GeoCraft session files are stored in subdirectories of your current workspace. However, you may store them in
	any directory you choose when saving a session.</p>
	<p>GeoCraft session files are written in XML code, so it is possible for you to invalidate a session file if you make 
	changes in the XML file (for example, by changing the names of keys within the file).</p>
	<p><strong>Caution</strong>! Do not edit the session files; you may lose or corrupt data within the session file and be unable to use it.</p>
	<h2>Managing GeoCraft Session Files</h2>
		<p>GeoCraft does not have an automated mechanism to delete, back up, or restore the GeoCraft session files. You must manage the GeoCraft 
		session file directories and their contents. If you no longer need a session file, navigate to the directory in which the session file 
		is stored, and manually delete that file.</p>
	<h2>Using Session Files</h2>
		<p>You can create as many session files as you want to in your working environment. A session is an instance of GeoCraft, and the state 
		in which that instance was when you saved it.</p>
		<p>Session files retain the state of your current GeoCraft environment, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/concepts/repository.htm"> Repository </a> contents </li>
				<li> data that was displayed in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/UI_Elements/gc_ui_viewers.htm">GeoCraft Viewers</a>, 
				and the settings at which that data was displayed </li>
				<li>GeoCraft algorithms that were open and in use</li>
				<li>user preferences, including the session unit system preference</li>
				<li>the following views, and any plots within the view:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>ABAVO</li>
						<li>3D View</li>
						<li>Map View</li>
						<li>Section View</li>
						<li>Wavelet View</li>
						<li>Well Log Plot (for LAS wells)</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<p>Currently, session files do not restore the following views:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Histogram Plot</li>
				<li>Scattergram Plot</li>
			</ul>
