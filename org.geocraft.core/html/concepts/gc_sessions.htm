<h1>GeoCraft Sessions</h1>
	<p>When you launch GeoCraft using a particular workspace, that GeoCraft instance is referred to as a GeoCraft <em>session</em>. You can
	save the session's state at any time and restore it later. A session can contain any of the following items. Session files retain 
	the state of your current GeoCraft environment, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/concepts/repository.htm"> Repository </a> contents </li>
				<li> data that was displayed in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/UI_Elements/gc_ui_viewers.htm">GeoCraft Viewers</a>, 
				and the settings at which that data was displayed </li>
				<li>GeoCraft algorithms that were open and in use</li>
				<li>user preferences, including the unit system</li>
				<li>the following views:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>ABAVO</li>
						<li>3D View</li>
						<li>Map View</li>
						<li>Section View</li>
						<li>Wavelet View</li>
						<li>Well Log View</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<p>Currently, session files do not restore Histogram and Scatter Plot views. <strong>Caution</strong>: 
		If you share your session with others, they <em>must</em> have file system permissions to access files 
		in that data store.</p>
	<h2>Quitting a GeoCraft Session</h2>
		<p><strong>Caution</strong> If you click the <strong>X</strong> in the top right corner of the GeoCraft window to quit the session, this closes 
		all separate plot windows immediately, and any plots that you were viewing in a separate window cannot be saved as part 
		of your session state when you exit GeoCraft. Always use <strong>File => Exit</strong> on the main menu to quit GeoCraft.</p>

		<p>When you select <strong>File => Exit</strong> to quit GeoCraft, you are prompted to save the last active session in which you worked. 
		If you are working in an existing session, the filename and path are populated with the existing session information.</p>

	<h2>Handling Units of Measure within a Session</h2>
		<p>When you launch GeoCraft, you will be prompted to specify the path of a workspace. If you specify a workspace
		that does not exist, it will be created, and you must also specify the unit system preference for your session. 
		When you load new data, GeoCraft will convert X,Y and Depth (only) units to the unit system of the session.</p>
		
		<p>You will specify unit of measure parameters in the <strong>Geocraft Workspace Chooser</strong> dialog:</p>

	<h2>Advantages to Using GeoCraft Sessions</h2>
		<p>GeoCraft sessions offer several advantages; because of the GeoCraft session functionality, you can easily:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>pick up where you left off in your work. GeoCraft saves your session in its current state; therefore, if you need to 
				leave a project	or a geophysical problem on which you are working for awhile, GeoCraft saves all of your data and the related tools 
				(algorithms, viewers, calculators, etc.) you were using to resolve your problem in their current state. When you are ready to 
				return to work, everything is waiting for you, just as you left it.</li>
				<li> share your work with others. The GeoCraft session file is a portable XML file; you can let other users point to your 
				session file and they will be able to work in the exact session environment that you set up.</li>
				<li>return to a starting point in your work. For example, if you save your session file at a certain point and then 
				perform several calculations or lay out several plots and realize that the more recent work you have done is not what 
				you wanted to do, you can always restore your prior saved session, and return to a "clean slate" within your work.</li>
			</ul>
