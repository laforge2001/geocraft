<h1>Saving a GeoCraft Session</h1>
	<p><strong>Warning!</strong> If you click the <strong>X</strong> in the top right corner of the GeoCraft 
	window to either exit or quit the session, this immediately closes all separate plot windows. As a result, 
	any plots in separate windows cannot be saved as part of your session state. Instead, when you are ready 
	to exit GeoCraft, always use <strong>File => Exit</strong> on the main menu.</p> 	
    <p>There are several ways that you can save the state a GeoCraft session to a session file (<strong>*.gcs</strong> file extension):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Every time you exit GeoCraft, you are prompted by the <strong>Save Session</strong> dialog to save the session. 
			Click <strong>Yes</strong>, and you will be prompted in a <strong>Session Selection</strong> dialog for a 
			filename and directory into which to session file.</li>
			<li>Select <strong>File => Save Session</strong> at any time to save the session in which 
			you are currently working. GeoCraft saves your session in its current state to the active session file.</li>
			<li>Select <strong>File => Save Session As</strong> to save your current session with a 
			new name. Use this option when you have made changes to the current session (for example: 
			changing the default layout for GeoCraft; or changing the project data that is being used)</li>
			<p>When you select the <strong>File => Save Session As</strong> option, GeoCraft prompts you to provide a name for the file.
			You may place the session file in the workspace Sessions subdirectory or browse to another directory.</p>
			<li>Select <strong>File => Save Session As Batch</strong> to save your current session as a 
			batch process.</li>
	     </ol>
