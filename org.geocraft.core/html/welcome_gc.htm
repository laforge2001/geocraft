<h1>Welcome to GeoCraft</h1>
<p>GeoCraft provides a common, open-source framework for developing software for geoscientists. 
    The framework provides services such as data i/o, such as from seismic or well log datastores, 
    display, and others necessary for geoscience applications. As a result, plugin modules or 
    algorithms have a common interface for reading and writing seismic traces, for example, 
    independent of where the data came from or what its format is.</p>
    <p>In addition, GeoCraft is being developed in a high level, platform and operating system 
    independent, modern environment based on Eclipse Rich Client Platform tools. GeoCraft plugins 
    are independent such that bugs in one plugin cannot affect other plugin modules. Executables 
    can be created for just one plugin as a stand alone application, or for many plugins.</p>
    <p>As modules are created, online documentation is also created. GeoCraft documentation 
    includes tutorials designed to illustrate various aspects of using GeoCraft.</p>
