<h1>Common Features in GeoCraft Viewers</h1>
	<p>The features in this topic are in most of the viewers that you use in GeoCraft. Features and functionality 
	that are specific to a viewer are documented in the help for that viewer (for example, the 3D Viewer help topics 
	contain information about functionality that is only available in the 3D Viewer).</p>
	<p>The following image shows an object being displayed in the GeoCraft Map Plot Viewer. Each viewer has Layers and Readout tabs; by default these 
	tabs are turned on. The Layers and Readout tabs contain	properties information about the image in the viewer. The Cursor ToolTip broadcast setting is 
	also turned on in this image. When you turn on the Cursor ToolTip broadcast setting in a viewer, a ToolTip (the light yellow pop-up box) will display 
	coordinates data for the image that is being displayed.</p>
