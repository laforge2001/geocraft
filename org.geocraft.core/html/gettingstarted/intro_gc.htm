<h1>Introduction to GeoCraft</h1>
	<p>GeoCraft is a software framework that runs geoscience algorithms.</p>
	
	<p><strong>GeoCraft uses both <em>workspace</em> and <em>session</em> files.</strong> A workspace is an area where 
	preferences are stored. No seismic or grid data are stored in the workspace. Hence, your workspace 
	can be located in your home area. Session files may be stored in the workspace or they may be located 
	anywhere. Session files may be used at a later date to restore the current GeoCraft setup. This includes 
	reloading all data, reopening displays and modules along with their parameters.</p>
	
	<p><strong>GeoCraft sessions have a fixed unit system preference which cannot be changed.</strong> 
	When GeoCraft starts, users must specify a workspace, either new or existing. If new, then a unit system 
	preference (metric or imperial) <em>for the session</em> is also selected. To help maintain data integrity, 
	once the session unit system is set, it cannot be changed. <em>If a saved session file is restored, any 
	existing data in the Repository are discarded, and data for the session are restored. The unit system is 
	always reset to match that of the restored data.</em></p> 
	
	<p><strong>GeoCraft never converts data units, such as velocities. Input velocities in m/sec are 
	<em>not</em> converted to ft/sec!</strong></p>
	
	<p><strong>GeoCraft does not change projection coordinate systems. However, GeoCraft will convert 
	X,Ys and depths (these 3 only) to match the session unit system</strong>. Even so, it is good 
	practice to not mix metric and imperial data in the same session.</p>
