  This package contains data objects that are used by Entities. However, unlike Entities, these
  objects do not have their own independent lifecycle. In other words, they do not have IMappers
  and are not directly persisted to the datastores.
  <p>
  In Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans they are called Value objects. He says 'these are the
  objects that describe things', and 'An object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain
  with no conceptual identity is called a VALUE OBJECT.'
