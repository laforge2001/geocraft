<h1>Group Multiples</h1>
	<p>Group Multiples computes specific, predefined multiples, including interbed multiples, from a 
	list of input horizons ordered by increasing time or depth. Input horizons may be in either time or 
	depth, but if they are in depth, an input velocity volume is also required.</p>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: Predefined Set #1 allows up to 5 input depth or time horizons. Predefined 
	Set #2 allows up to 3 input time horizons. GeoCraft creates multiples with a <a href="group_multis_naming_conv.htm"> common naming convention</a>
	and format to clearly specify peglegs <a href="group_multis_predefined_ref.htm">(see predefined multiples 
	for Set #1)</a>. The naming convention for output multiple horizons does not reflect the names of the input 
	horizons.  However, users can change the default prefix for output horizon names to do this.</p>
	<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Input horizons must be in order by increasing depth or time. If they are not, 
	then resulting multiples may extend above zero time. If the input are depth horizons, the output will be
	clipped at zero depth by the time to depth conversion. Time horizons are not clipped at zero time.</p>
	
	<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Group Multiples always writes the output horizons back to the input horizon 
	datastore rather than storing them only in memory. This is necessary because many horizons can be created, 
	and if these are large horizons, they could consume all available memory.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Group Multiples Algorithm</h2>
	<p>Group Multiples can generate two different, predefined sets of multiples. If the input horizons are in time, results 
	are in time and a velocity volume is not required. If the input horizons are in depth and you select Set #1, a 
	velocity volume is required.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Set #1</em> converts up to 5 depth horizons to time, computes a specific set of time multiples, 
		and then converts these horizons back to depth. Input depth horizons require an input velocity volume. If the input 
		horizons are in time, results will be in time and a velocity volume is <em>not</em> required.</li>
		<li><em>Set #2</em> computes all multiples for up to 3 input time horizons.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All horizons created by Group Multiples share a common naming convention to describe pegleg paths: 
	<a href="group_multis_naming_conv.htm">common naming convention and equation format</a>.</p>
<h2>Generating Multiples from Selected Input Horizons</h2>
	<ol>
	
		<li>Load horizon data into GeoCraft.</li>
		<li>Load a velocity volume (with units of velocity) into GeoCraft if the horizons are in depth.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
	<p>A <strong>Selection Dialog</strong> pops up, listing all of the horizons loaded into GeoCraft.</p>
		<li>Select the horizons to use in the calculation and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
		<li>Sort horizons by increasing time or depth in the <strong>Horizons</strong> field, by selecting 
		individual horizons and using the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons to move the 
		horizons toward the top or bottom of the list.</li>
		<li>Select an interval <strong>Velocity Volume</strong> if horizons are in depth.</li>
		<li>Select a <strong>Predefined Group of Multiples</strong>:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Set #1 (Maximum of 5 Horizons)</strong> calculates predefined multiples for up to 
				5 depth or time horizons</li>
				<li><strong>Set #2 (Maximum of 3 Horizons)</strong> calculates all possible multiples for up 
				to 3 time horizons</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Select a depth <strong>Conversion Method</strong>:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Cell-based</strong> - velocity is calculated analogous to a constant conversion method. 
				Velocity is held constant vertically in depth or time between input velocities.</li>
				<li><strong>Knee-based</strong> - velocity is calculated analogous to a linear conversion method.
				Velocity is linearly interpolated vertically in depth or time between input velocities.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Accept the <strong>Horizon Prefix</strong>, or type in a new value that complies 
		with <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/gettingstarted/gcfund_filename_rq.htm"> GeoCraft file-naming requirements</a>.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
			<p>GeoCraft calculates <strong>and saves</strong> the multiple horizons to the same location where the original horizons 
	are located. GeoCraft creates multiples with a <a href="group_multis_naming_conv.htm">common naming convention and 
	equation format</a>. The new multiples populate into the <strong>Repository</strong> window, under the <strong>Grids</strong> folder.</p>
