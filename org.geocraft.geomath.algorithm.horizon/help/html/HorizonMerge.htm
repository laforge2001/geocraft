<h1>Horizon Merge</h1>
<p>The Horizon Merge algorithm allows you to merge horizons by performing Minimum, Maximum, or OR operations on several horizons.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must use horizons with exactly the same geometry in your calculations to merge the horizons; if the 
geometries of the horizons differ, this algorithm will not work.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Horizon Merge</h2>
<p>Horizon Merge is similar to algorithms in the Basic Math (Minimum and Maximum) and Boolean Algebra (OR) algorithms, but you may 
select an unlimited number of horizons for this operation (the Basic Math and Boolean Algebra algorithms limit you to 2 input horizons).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once horizons are selected, the HorizonMinMaxOr allows you to change their order by moving them up or down in 
the list. Horizons are processed in a top-down order for the OR merge operation.</p>
<p>Horizon Merge does not modify the original input horizon(s).</p>
<h3>How the Horizon Merge Algorithm Works</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>For the <em>OR</em> operation the algorithm starts with the top-most horizon <em>first</em> and searches for the
		first non-null value in the list of input horizons at each node.</li>
		<li>For the <em>MIN</em> and <em>MAX</em> operations the algorithm scans all input horizons, ignoring order, and outputs 
		either the minimum or the maximum value at each node.</li>
		<li>If all horizons are null, a null is output.</li>
	</ol>
<h2>Performing a Horizon Minimum, Maximum, or OR Operation on Several Horizons in a Single Run</h2>
	<p><strong>Caution:</strong> The horizons that you create during this procedure are held in memory <em>only</em>; if you do not save them before you quit GeoCraft, 
	you will lose the data.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Load horizon data into GeoCraft.</li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button next to the <strong>Horizons</strong> field.</li>
	<p>A <strong>Selection Dialog</strong> displays, listing all of the horizons that you have loaded into GeoCraft.</p>
		<li>Select the horizons you want to use in the calculation and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
		<li>In the <strong>Horizons</strong> field, select individual horizons and use the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons to 
		move the horizons toward the top or bottom of the calculation order. GeoCraft gives preferential treatment to the top-most horizon in the list when
		trying to replace null values in other horizons within the list. If you selected a horizon you do not want, highlight the horizon and 
		click <strong>Remove</strong>.</li>
		<li>In <strong>The Operation to Perform</strong> field, select <strong>Minimum</strong>, <strong>Maximum</strong>, or <strong>OR</strong>.</li>
		<li>Accept the <strong>Name</strong>, or type in a new one. Make sure that the name 
		complies with <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/gettingstarted/gcfund_filename_rq.htm"> GeoCraft file-naming requirements</a>.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
			<p>GeoCraft performs the operations on the selected horizons, and populates the new horizons into the <strong>Repository</strong>.</p>
		<li>Use the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.ui.mapviewer/help/html/gc_vwr_map.htm">GeoCraft Map Plot</a> to view the results.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You may now plot and view the data in a GeoCraft viewer.</p>
