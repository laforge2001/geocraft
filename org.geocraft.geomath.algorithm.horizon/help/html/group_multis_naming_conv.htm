<title>Naming Convention and Equation Format for Horizons Created by Multiples Algorithms</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Naming and Equation Conventions for Multiples Algorithms</h1>
<p>The Group Multiples algorithms create multiples as new horizons with a special naming convention 
in order to clearly specify the travel path for each multiple.</p>

<p>The form is always something like <strong>hm_<em>NNN</em>_<em>MM</em></strong>, where the 
<em>"hm"</em> is the Horizon Prefix set by the user. The Ns represent the primary reflections 
at horizon number "N". The Ms represent reflections at horizon number "M" for pegleg paths. 
There will always be one less number of M's than N's. When reading a travel path the M's are 
always inserted between the N's. An M of 0 represents a surface reflection.</p>

<p>A few examples will clarify this scheme. Let the first input 
horizon be waterbottom, the second be top salt and the third be base salt.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>hm_11_0</em> indicates travel time from waterbottom (i.e. N=1) up to the surface (i.e. M=0) 
			and back (second N=1), or the first waterbottom multiple</li>
		<li><em>hm_111_00</em> indicates travel time from waterbottom (N=1) up to the surface (M=0) and back,  
		    and then up to the surface and back a second time, or the second waterbottom multiple</li>
		<li><em>hm_1111_000</em> indicates travel time from waterbottom up to the surface and back a 
			total of 3 times, or the third waterbottom multiple</li>
		<li><em>hm_22_0</em> indicates travel time from top salt (N=2) up to the surface (M=0) and back, 
		    or the first top salt multiple</li>
		<li><em>hm_22_1</em> indicates travel time from top salt (N=2) up to the waterbottom (M=1) 
			and back, or the first top salt, waterbottom multiple</li>
		<li><em>hm_33_1</em> indicates travel time from base salt (N=3) up to the waterbottom (M=1) 
			and back, or the first base salt, waterbottom multiple</li>
		<li><em>hm_33_2</em> indicates travel time from base salt (N=3) up to the top salt horizon (M=2) 
			and back, or the first top salt, base salt multiple</li>
		<li><em>hm_3333_102</em> indicates travel time from base salt up to waterbottom (M=1), then back to base 
			salt, then up to the surface (M=0) and back to base salt, and finally up to top salt (M=2) and 
			back to base salt (N=3)</li>
		<li><em>hm_321_00</em> indicates travel time from base salt (N=3) up to the surface (M=0), then down 
			to top salt (N=2), then back up to the surface (M=0) and finally down to top salt (N=1)</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>More Examples of the Multiples Naming Convention</strong></p>
<p>The actual equation used for each multiple can also be determined from the naming convention. For example 
suppose a multiple is named <strong>hm_331_10</strong>.</p>
<table width="700" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tr>
<td><strong>Naming Convention</strong></td>
<td><strong>Interpretation</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hm</td>
<td>
<p>this Horizon Prefix parameter set by the user</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_</td>
<td>first underscore in the file name; every value between the first and second underscore is added in the multiples calculation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>331</td>
<td>values representing the horizons that will be added in the multiples calculation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_</td>
<td>second underscore in the file name; everything value after this is subtracted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>values representing the horizons that will be subtracted from the multiples calculation; remember that zero values are ignored by GeoCraft</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Travel time calculation</strong></p>
<p>Using variable <strong>333_10</strong> from this example, GeoCraft would perform the following calculation:</p>
<p><strong>H3 + (H3 - H1) + H3</strong></p>
