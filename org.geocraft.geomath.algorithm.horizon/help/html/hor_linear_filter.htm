<h1>Convolution (Linear Filters) Algorithm</h1>
	<p>The Linear Filters algorithm smooths horizons with the Gaussian, Square Mean, or Circular Mean filtering method.</p>
	<h2>Overview of the Linear Filters Algorithm</h2>
		<p>Linear filters give the same response in all parts of a data set; they do not adapt to the data. GeoCraft calculates 
		linear filter size in pixels (the picture element). All GeoCraft calculation results from seismic horizon samples 
		are measured in pixels.</p> 
		<p>Linear filters work by convolution within a moving window that is called a <em>kernel</em>. The input pixel is at 
		the center of the kernel. The nonzero part of the kernel is the kernel <em>support</em>. Linear filters apply the 
		same weights to all pixels in a data set, so they are very fast. However, linear filters smooth every pixel 
		equally, so they do not perform sensitive smoothing on the data set.</p>
	<h2>Using the GeoCraft Linear Filter Algorithm to Smooth a Horizon</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Load seismic horizon data into GeoCraft.</li>
			<li>Select a <strong>Horizon</strong>.</li>
			<li>Select a <strong>Linear Filter</strong>:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Gaussian</strong>: applies weights according to the Gaussian distribution, where the
					kernel and degree of smoothing are controlled; however, noise is simply mixed into the result, and smoothing
					is random. For best results, remove spikes from a sample before you use a Gaussian filter to smooth the 
					sample.</li>
					<li><strong>Square mean</strong>: a linear filter with a square-shaped support (the support
					is the nonzero part of the filter) </li>
					<li><strong>Circular mean</strong>: a linear filter with a circle-shaped support (the support
					is the nonzero part of the filter)</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Accept the sample <strong>Size</strong>, or type a new value in the field. Size is the number of 
			inlines and xlines that are calculated for the sample.</li>
			<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Size must be an odd number that is 3 or greater.</p>
			<li>Accept the <strong>Name</strong>, or type in a new one. Make sure that the name 
			complies with <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.core/html/gettingstarted/gcfund_filename_rq.htm"> GeoCraft file-naming requirements</a>.</li>
			<li><em>Optional</em> Type in <strong>Comments</strong>. Text typed in this field displays in the 
			<strong>Property</strong>view when the new horizon is selected in the <strong>Repository</strong>.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>.</li>
				<p>GeoCraft runs the calculation, and creates the new, smoothed, horizon. The new horizon is in the
				<strong>Repository</strong>, under the <strong>Grids</strong> folder.</p>
			<li>Use the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.geocraft.ui.mapviewer/help/html/gc_vwr_map.htm">GeoCraft Map Plot</a> to view the results.</li>
