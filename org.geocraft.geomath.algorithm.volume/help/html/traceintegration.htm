<h1>Trace Integration</h1>
		<p>Trace Integration transforms existing reflection-seismic data into relative impedance.</p>
	<h2>Overview of the Trace Integration Algorithm</h2>
		<p>Performing trace integration on data can be helpful for observing cases like fining upward 
		sands that do not have a top sand reflection. Trace integration with an operator length of one is 
		simply a running sum of traces samples when the data are regularly sampled. However this process 
		effectively boosts low frequency noise. As a result trace integration is often followed by a low 
		cut bandpass filter. The Trace Integration algorithm in GeoCraft allows users to perform both 
		processes in one step by setting the operator length larger than 1.</p>
		<p>The Trace Integration algorithm works with 2D and 3D volume data.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Trace integration should be applied to zero-phase broadband reflection data.</p>
        <p><strong>CAUTION!</strong>: Some 2D data stores limit the number of characters in file names. For example, 
	in some data stores the file name must be 9 characters or less. If you are working with 2D volume data 
	from a data store with file name limitations, <em>modify</em> the GeoCraft 
	<strong>Volume Name</strong> to comply with the data store requirements.</p>
<h2>Transforming Reflection Seismic Data into Relative Impedance</h2>

			<li>Select the <strong>Type of Volume</strong>:</li>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>2D</strong>: two-dimensional volume data</li>
				  <li><strong>3D</strong>: three-dimensional volume data</li>
				</ul>
            <li>Select a seismic <strong>Volume</strong>.</li>
			<li><em>Optional; only perform this step if you want to use an area of interest.</em> Select the <strong>Use Area 
			of Interest?</strong> check box.</li>
			<li><em>Optional; only perform this step if you want to limit the volume to a specific area of interest.</em> Select an
			<strong>Area of Interest</strong>.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Operator Length</strong> field, accept the value (80) in the field, or type in a new value.</li>
			<p><em>Operator Length</em> defines the length of the integration operator.</p>
			<p>When Operator Length is set to 1 sample, the operator does a running sum of trace samples. 
			This produces a 90-degree phase shift and a 1/f high cut. This effect is often seen 
			as a ramp in time or a low frequency spike, which can be removed by applying a low-cut filter.</p>
			<p>When Operator Length is set to a value larger than 1, such as the default value of 80 samples, 
            the operator is a sliding window that adds the nearest 80 trace samples. An Operator Length value of 
            80 greatly reduces the time ramp and removes low frequencies, so that you may not have to apply 
            additional filtering to the calculation.</p>
