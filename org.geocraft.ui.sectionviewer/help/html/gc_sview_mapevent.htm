<h1>Viewing Lines Selected in Map View within the Section View</h1>
	<p>Section View can display Inlines, Xlines, or Arbitrary lines selected in Map View. You can 
	broadcast the cursor position from the Map View to the Section View, or from the Section View
	to the Map View.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open Map View on the <strong>Survey</strong> node under <em>2D Seismic</em> or 
			<em>3D Seismic</em> folders in the <em>Repository</em> tree. This node contains the 
			geometry for the volume and must be displayed in Map View. If you also desire to view 
			a particular horizon, simply open a Map View for that horizon and click the 
			<strong>Cursor reception is disabled</strong> icon to enable cursor tracking. 
			However, section lines can only be selected from the Survey Map View.</li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Cursor broadcast is disabled</strong> on the Survey Map View toolbar.</li>
			<li>If not already displayed, open Section View for the data volume.</li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Cursor receive is disabled</strong> on the Section View toolbar.</li>
			<li>In the Survey Map View <em>Layers</em> tab right-click on the <strong>Survey</strong> node 
			and select either an Inline, Xline, or Arbitrary Section from the pop up menu.</li>
			<li>If you want to select a specific inline or xline, click the <em>Readout</em> tab 
			in the Map View so you can read the inline and xline number.</li> 
			<li>When the cursor changes to a plus sign over the map, select the line to display by pressing MB2. 
			For arbitrary lines left click to draw the line and when done click MB2 to display the line 
			in Section View. The selected line is now displayed in Section View.</li>
			<li>In Section View click the <strong>Cursor broadcast is disabled</strong> icon.</li>
			<li>In Map View click the <strong>Cursor reception is disabled</strong> icon.</li>
			</ol>
	<p>Now as the cursor is moved around in Section View, its position can be seen in Map View - i.e. 
	the Survey Map View or any other horizon displayed in Map View with cursor reception enabled. If 
	the cursor is moved in Map View to intersect the line of section, its position in Section View 
	is annotated by a plus sign at the top of the nearest trace.</p>
